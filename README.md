Experimenting with solutions to the traveling salesperson problem.

When running the script you must specify the number of points as the first argument. By default the path is closed but you can open it using the optional "-o" or "--open" argument. 
```
python main.py 5
```

#### Controls:
- **N**: Get new random points.
- **Space**: Pause/unpause.
- **Enter**: Do a single update (only when paused).
- **Esc**: Quit.
